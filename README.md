 Okay. This is a script in AutoHotKey I made to play the game [Heat Signature](http://heatsig.com/). You can theoretically use it on the desktop, but I've *sort of* designed it to work on mobile devices. You just download the executable, run it, and then launch Heat Signature.
 ## How to use it:
 I hope it's self explanatory, but in essence, you'll get 3 windows. The first one says "E" and "F". Those are your E and F keys. You'll use them to interact with the game. The next window has a blank button. This is your space key. You'll be using this a lot, because it stops time. The last keys say directions. These move you in a certain direction. Because I couldn't figure out how to make autohotkey detect if I was holding down a key, you'll need to tap once to start moving in a direction, and tap again to stop.
 
 ## Planned features
 - Scrap all of this, replace it with something even more convoluted, but easier to control.
